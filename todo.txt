- Work on adding glow using surfaces 
- Also work on adding primitives and a physics engine
-  look at ironscorpion's engine and check out the maths for polygonal rendering


- issues 
    - fix parser not taking in empty spaces
    - fix lists in extd_cstd
    - check for possible pointer mismanagement
    - work on art program and level editor
    - add camera to game props 
    - remove need for renderer to be passed in function arguments through passing props instead of cam
    - event functions possibly lead to memory leaks so check hash table and create replace function or reuse ht in props 
    - config file memory leaks
    - work on better resource management
    - add polygons/rounded rects
    - add colorkeying in textures before surface
    - fix file api as it returns a stack allocated variable 
    - add opengl shaders
    - add a physics engine
    - config file ptr dereference


- project plan:
    - implement movement:
        - left and Right
        - slipping
        
    - implement platforms and different tiles in the levels
        - coins
        - fire
        - handle collisions
    - implement different tile behaviours
    - implement game juice:
        - timer
        - level end screen
        - game saving
    - particles
